          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p >Born in 1932 in Shpola, Ukrainian SSR.<br>
          After graduating from the Kyiv Institute of Civil Engineering, he worked for a while, but David wanted to work in
        animation since childhood, so in 1959 he came to work at the "Kyivnaukfilm" studio as an animator.<br>
         <span>As the animator himself said, he did not attend art schools, but learned to draw on his own.</span> 
          Since 1964, he has been the
        director of this association </p><br>
        <p><span>Cherkaskyi himself works in the drawn technology. In his films, Cherkassky used several innovative techniques for Soviet
        cinematography. He combined animation and game shooting in the frame. Made three-dimensional "flyovers" that imitate
        panning in art cinema, creating such an effect as if the camera were flying around the characters. In his films, sounds
        like "Boom", "Bang", etc. were drawn, just like in comics.</span></p><br>
        <p>In 1991, became the President of the International Festival of Animated Films "KROK".<br>
